        <li>
          Involved in designing & developing a serverless application running on
          AWS lambda with a NodeJS backend. Extensively used the AWS serverless
          framework to develop a loosely coupled scalable Lambda functions as
          part of a distributed microservices application
        </li>
        <li>
          Extensive use of Typescript to ensure type safety of Javascript code.
          used javascript asynchronous patterns (Callbacks, Promises and

        </li>
        <li>
          Developed an application in ReactJS from scratch to automate the
          monitoring of EOM(Mainframe) server. The React application called a
          NodeJS API on the backend which in turn ran several database scripts.
          Created a webhook to send automated reports to a Microsoft Teams
          channel.

        </li>
        <li>
          Experience with advanced design patterns like Saga pattern, Event
          Driven CQRS design patterns and using libraries like Mass Transit and
          Polly for building resilient microservice based architecture with
          retry/circuit breaker patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>
